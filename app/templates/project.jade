        The Halo "Remember Reach" site used an automobile assembly robot with a laser pointer to create a monument from 60,000 points of light. Each user could select a single points of light, which would in turn be illuminated by the robot and composited into the scene. The activity of the robot was live-streamed over the website for the duration of the campaign.
